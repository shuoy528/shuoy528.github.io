This study investigates the short-run effects of the U.S.-China trade war on U.S. agricultural futures
prices, focusing on five primary commodities: soybeans, corn, wheat, rice, and oats. Initiated in early 2018 by
President Trump, the trade war resulted in substantial tariffs imposed by both countries, severely impacting
the U.S. agricultural sector. To mitigate farmers’ losses, the U.S. government introduced $28 billion in trade
aid packages for farmers. This paper utilizes daily futures price data for these grains from 2004 to 2020 and
comprehensive supply and demand factors. Due to the non-stationarity of the data, first-difference regressions
are employed to quantify the price effects of tariffs and government payments. The findings indicate that
a 25% Chinese tariff on U.S. soybeans led to a significant decrease in soybean and wheat futures prices,
highlighting the severe short-term impacts of trade barriers on agricultural markets. Additionally, the analysis
reveals that the massive trade aid payments had mixed effects on futures prices, challenging the assumption
that such payments would not further distort the market.

In this paper, we developed an open-source package to analyze the overall trend and responses of
both carbon use efficiency (CUE) and corn yield to climate factors for the contiguous United
States. Our algorithm enables the automatic retrieval of remote sensing data through Google Earth
Engine (GEE) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) agricultural production data at the
county level through an application programming interface (API). Firstly, we integrated satellite
products of net primary productivity and gross primary productivity based on the Moderate
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, and climatic variables from the European
Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Secondly, we calculated CUE and commonly used
climate metrics. Thirdly, we investigated the spatial heterogeneity of these variables. We applied a
random forest algorithm to identify the key climate drivers of CUE and crop yield, and estimated
the responses of CUE and yield to climate variability using the spatial moving window regression
across the U.S. Our results show that growing degree days (GDD) has the highest predictive power
for both CUE and yield, while extreme degree days (EDD) is the least important explanatory
variable. Moreover, we observed that in most areas of the U.S., yield increases or stays the same
with higher GDD and precipitation. However, CUE decreases with higher GDD in the north and
shows more mixed and fragmented interactions in the south. Notably, there are some exceptions
where yield is negatively correlated with precipitation in the Missouri and Mississippi River Valleys.
As global warming continues, we anticipate a decrease in CUE throughout the vast northern part
of the country, despite the possibility of yield remaining stable or increasing.

**Designing Insurance under Climate Change**

Government intervention in insurance markets, such as flood, wildfire, and crop insurance, is a common response to the growing risks associated with climate change. As the frequency of extreme weather events increases, these aggregate shocks necessitate policies that help stabilize incomes and mitigate the economic fallout. However, subsidized insurance programs may also reduce incentives for ex-ante adaptation. In this paper, we examine this trade-off in the context of the U.S. Federal Crop Insurance Program (FCIP) and its impact on farmers' adaptation to climate change. Using data on insurance contracts, yields, farm incomes, input expenditures, and weather realizations over three decades, we find that higher levels of insurance coverage are associated with both larger yield losses and reduced input use during extreme weather events. This suggests that subsidized crop insurance may diminish incentives to mitigate weather shocks. Yet, we also find evidence that higher insurance coverage effectively stabilizes farm incomes during extreme weather events. An optimal policy design would minimize this empirically observed trade-off between income stabilization and incentives to adapt. To explore this, we develop a structural model of insurance choice and production decisions to quantify the net welfare effects of subsidized insurance and simulate alternative policy designs. This work is ongoing; we will present preliminary reduced-form estimates, outline the empirical strategy for estimating the structural model, and discuss planned counterfactuals, which include policies such as replacing subsidies with conditional or unconditional transfers and adjusting the subsidy schedule.

This paper analyzes the management strategies employed by Michigan highbush blueberry growers to combat Spotted Wing Drosophila (SWD), an invasive vinegar fly originating from East Asia that poses a significant threat to fruit crops. A dynamic structural econometric model is developed to study growers' decisions related to fly and larva monitoring as well as insecticide application. The model is applied to a comprehensive dataset comprising daily decision records of blueberry growers in Michigan. The findings provide insights into the effectiveness of various management strategies and their implications for economic outcomes in the agricultural sector.

**Paying Smallholder Farmers to Increase Carbon Sequestration by Changing Agricultural Practices: Evidence from Odisha**  
with [Aprajit Mahajan](https://are.berkeley.edu/~aprajit/) and [Sayantan Mitra](https://sites.google.com/view/sunnymitra/). \[_piloting completed, full RCT to start in 2025_\]

This project incentivizes smallholder farmers in rural India to adopt agricultural practices that improve soil carbon sequestration. We carry out a full RCT that pays farmers as a function of measured improvements in soil organic content in a context with liquidity constraints. The RCT lays the groundwork for developing a larger-scale program that links small farmers to commercial firms providing carbon credits. The project will also explore the potential of satellite data to validate the adoption and impact of regenerative agricultural practices, which will be essential for any scale-up.

A practical and reliable way to estimate field-scale evapotranspiration (ET) and CO2 fluxes can significantly help with the optimization of water use and other sustainable practices in precision agriculture and ecosystem restoration. AmeriFlux is a "Big Data" framework updated through a tower-network that provides ecosystem measurements including water, greenhouse gas (GHG) and energy fluxes. Its sites are located in North, Central and South America, but they are limited to one or a few points in the region. The main focus of our research is to develop an effective and wide-ranging methodology for field-scale hydrological and carbon flux estimations based on the integration of AmeriFlux data and satellite images. The AmeriFlux data we use cover a pair of commercially farmed, adjacent rice fields located in Lonoke County, Arkansas for the period 2016-2018. We first illustrate that there is significant and numerically large correlation between the ET measurements and CO2 fluxes made at the AmeriFlux sites and land surface products derived from satellite remotely sensed data (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), air temperature, precipitation, and surface pressure) derived by Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 sensors. Linear regression and random forest models were then developed for predictions. We will explore the spatial and temporal pattern of the data in the future analysis, as well as integrate with local high resolution geophysical data to better understand the effect of the soil spatial heterogeneity, which is known to impact plant development. We envision that the integration of such methodology with eco-hydrological models will enable capabilities to better estimate water use efficiency and carbon storage potential at the field-scale.
