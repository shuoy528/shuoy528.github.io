I am a Ph.D. candidate in Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Berkeley, expected to complete my degree in May 2026. My primary field of study is Agricultural Economics, with secondary fields in Environmental and Energy Economics and Empirical Industrial Organization. I hold an M.S. in Applied Economics and Management from Cornell University and a B.S. in International Trade & Economics and Accounting (double major) from the University of International Business and Economics.

My research focuses on regenerative agriculture and agricultural policy, exploring their impacts on environmental sustainability, climate change adaptation, and mitigation. These studies are innovative in combining economic and econometric models with data generated from remote sensing and machine learning techniques.
