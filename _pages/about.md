I am a Ph.D. candidate in Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Berkeley, with an expected completion date of May 2026. My primary field of study is Agricultural Economics, with secondary fields in Environmental and Energy Economics and Empirical Industrial Organization. I hold an M.S. in Applied Economics and Management from Cornell University and a B.S. in International Trade & Economics and Accounting (double major) from the University of International Business and Economics.

My research focuses on conservation practices and agricultural policy, with a particular interest in their roles in promoting environmental sustainability and supporting climate change adaptation and mitigation. My work integrates applied econometric methods and empirical industrial organization models with high-resolution data derived from remote sensing and machine learning tools.
